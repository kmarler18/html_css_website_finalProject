# html_css_website_finalProject
For my HTML5 / CSS3 class, I was tasked with creating a website. I created one for my voice over business.

You can view the website <a href="https://kyle-marler.000webhostapp.com/index.html" target="_blank">here</a>.

I implemented many HTML features I learned throughout the course including a pricing table, form elements and embedded YouTube videos for my portfolio.

I also utilized various CSS techniques, including a flex box to responsively design my video portfolio, a print style sheet for my home page, and positioning properties to make the "about" page elements slightly offset and more visually interesting. 

Furthermore, I used transition style properties to create an appealing effect on the navigation menu, and I used responsive design techniques to display a navigation icon for devices under a certain width. 

I received a 100% on the project from my professor <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mohamed-b-ali-20b8b313/" target="_blank">Mohamed B. Ali</a>.
