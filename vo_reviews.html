                <blockquote>In search of a non-standard voiceover, we listened to over 200 voices. 
                Kyle is unique. And I don't really want our competitors to know about him.</blockquote>
                <p>-Julie - Administrator @ 'Anton Somewhere' YouTube Channel</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <blockquote>Kyle is my go-to for any voiceover work - from marketing promos to educational spots. 
                He's super easy to work. [He] is the ideal freelancer. 
                He intuitively executes projects - delivering exactly what we need and always on time.</blockquote>

            <div>
                <blockquote>Kyle Rocks!! What can I say when I need something he is there. 
                He has such a naturalness to his voice and really knows how to come across as if he is 
                right there in the room with you, that is hard for a Voice Actor to accomplish =) 
                I will be returning to use his skills in more of my eLearning courses for sure! 
                Fast Turnaround as well..hire him, you won't regret it!</blockquote>

                <blockquote>Always a pleasure getting a demo done by Kyle. 
                I know I can trust that it will be high quality and have a really awesome flare to it. 
                Very professional service. Did a wonderful high quality vocal track of my song. 
                Worked very quickly and got the brief spot on first time.</blockquote>
                <p>-Ian Shortall - Australian Songwriter</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <blockquote>This guy right here is the absolute standard of professionalism. 
                Kyle was a pleasure to work with and is truly a master of his craft. 
                You don't come across people like him too often. His work is phonemical and to add to it. 
                He is a easy going guy.</blockquote>

            <div>
                <blockquote>Kyle was able to do a really quick turnaround on the work which was vital for my job. 
                I sent him the finalized scripts in the morning and he submitted 2 takes of each episode by that same night. 
                He takes direction on VOs very well and his lively, young, 
                bright voice is a great option for character voices or other voice-over projects.</blockquote>
